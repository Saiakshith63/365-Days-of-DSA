🚀 Selection Sort - The Basics! 🔍
Selection Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the sorted portion.
select minimums and swapping - (from strivers)

🔹 How it Works?
1️⃣ Find the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array.
2️⃣ Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
3️⃣ Move to the next position and repeat the process until the entire array is sorted!

🔹 Characteristics of Selection Sort:
✅ In-Place Sorting (No extra memory required)
✅ Not Stable (Relative order of equal elements may change)
✅ Best for Small Datasets

        n=len(arr)
        
        for i in range(n-1):
            mini=i
            
            for j in range(i+1,n):
                if arr[j]<arr[mini]:
                    mini = j
                    
            arr[i], arr[mini] = arr[mini], arr[i]
